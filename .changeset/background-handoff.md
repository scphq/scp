A Claude Code session sent to the background from its terminal keeps its name, children, grants, groups, title and unread mail. Its background process claims with the new `harness_handoff` flag, and the broker hands the origin's endpoint over even while the old terminal process still holds it, unless that process is still busy, then closes the old process's connections so it comes back under a fresh name. A fork started from another terminal stays a parallel fork with its own name. `swarm relink --dry-run` lists background sessions stranded by an older CLI next to their idle origin, and `swarm relink --live` applies them.

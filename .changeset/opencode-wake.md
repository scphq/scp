Idle OpenCode sessions wake on new messages. The OpenCode plugin keeps one `swarm hook opencode --wake 50` waiting while no session of the process runs a turn, and submits what it prints as a new prompt; a starting turn stops the waiter, and printed messages are confirmed so turn-boundary injection never shows them again. `SCP_WAKE=0` turns it off. `inject` takes `wait_s` to wait for a delivery to offer.

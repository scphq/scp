The hub can judge its own account's sends between machines before delivery: `RelayHub.configureJudge` takes a judge policy, and `holds`, `holdShow`, `holdRelease` and `holdRefuse` review what it held. Without a policy the hub holds no judge and its send paths are unchanged. The judge gate moved from the broker into `@scp-dev/hub` as `JudgeGate`, with overridable caps and an injectable key file reader; the broker's behaviour is unchanged.

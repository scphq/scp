Wake hooks for hibernated sessions and remote spawn runners. A provider marks a session hibernated with `swarm hibernate --wake <provider> --ref <ref>`: it shows as `hibernated` (wakeable, never offline), and a delivery to it runs the provider's configured waker, which brings the session back to reclaim its endpoint and drain its queue. A machine whose bridge is down can register a signed wake webhook with `swarm machine wake-url`. `swarm spawn --via <runner>` hands the spawn to a configured runner that starts the session on another machine, where it shows under its parent through a cross-machine link and hands back to it.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 44d3bf6: Endpoints advertise how they wake when idle: `wake` is `channels`, `pi`, `opencode-plugin`, `codex-app-server` or null, set by whatever connects (the channels MCP shim, the pi extension, the OpenCode plugin waiter, the Codex launcher) and carried in `EndpointView`, the bridge mirror and the hub. `swarm list` gets a WAKE column, an idle agent no message wakes shows `idle (next turn)`, and send results say `delivered; waking it` or `delivered; it sees this at its next turn` for an idle recipient. Claude Code subagent handles are now `<parent>-<short type>-<id4>` from the parent's current handle, and a subagent's title comes from the description its parent launched it with.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 4422a53: A session started by hand can sit under an orchestrator: `swarm join --under <parent>` (MCP `relay_join` with `under`) links the session itself under an agent it may message, taking on a spawned worker's place and scope; `swarm adopt <child> [--parent <p>]` links any local root agent and its subtree, for the human at a terminal (an agent without one is refused); `swarm unlink [<child>]` puts it back at the root, for the human unless the policy sets `defaults.unlink: "self"`. Cycles are refused, both are audited as `adopt` and `unlink`, a linked session's later claims take it back where it sits, and the bridge resyncs so the hub, the other machines, `swarm list --tree`, the dashboard tree and the graph show the new parent.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ebd50b6: Sessions join the relay on demand: `swarm join [<handle>]` (MCP `relay_join`) puts the session that runs the shell on the relay, hooked or not, and names it once; `swarm name <handle>` renames a root session in place, keeping its id, mail, threads and relations, refusing a handle another endpoint holds (a spawned worker only with the policy's `defaults.rename: "self"`), and the hub renames its mirror in place; `swarm leave` (MCP `relay_leave`) takes it offline with its mail kept. `swarm setup --join manual` keeps hooked sessions off the relay until they join; `auto` stays the default. A send to an agent no live session holds says `queued: no live session holds <addr>`, and `--live` (MCP `live: true`) refuses it with `not_live` instead of queueing; `swarm list` shows live endpoints by default and offline ones with `--all`. `swarm claude` without `--name` asks the session to pick its own name with `swarm name`.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 7c91739: Idle Claude Code sessions wake on peer messages. `swarm claude [--name N] [claude args...]` starts Claude Code with the scp channel loaded, and `swarm setup`, `swarm up` and `swarm mcp install --harness claude` mount its MCP server with `--channels`. The server pushes only to a client that declares `claude/channel` or that `swarm claude` started, so other sessions keep the hook path. An inbox wait that runs into the 50 s cap says so.
